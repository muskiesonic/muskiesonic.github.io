Introducing my new blog. I'm interested in learning game dev and I want to detail my progress. My first step is to re-create a classic game.

Tetris... written in MonoGame (https://github.com/muskiesonic/mono-tetris). I want to document all of the challenges and discoveries I make here. As I create new features, fix bugs, or even go exploring in code or art, I'll come back here to record what happened.
